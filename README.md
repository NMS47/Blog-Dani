<p>I know what you are thinking, another typical blog. However in this one I added a couple neat features made for Dani.</p>
<p>As i wanted it to be as easier to use as posible, i made the CRUD system completely codeless</p>
<p>The design and creation of post is done completely in the user side, being Dani the only superuser with permition to make CRUD operations</p>
